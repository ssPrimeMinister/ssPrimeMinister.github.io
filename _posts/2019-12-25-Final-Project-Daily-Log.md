Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**

1.) Today I tried to generalize reading in a CSV file. I have realized that some datasets contain non-UTF-8 characters, thus not allowing pandas to convert it to a dataset.

2.) I learned how to read the bytes of the a file and display them, but I am still trying to test each character (whether it is UTF-8 or not).

3.) All the resources I found to my questions were written in Python 2, so I still need to find a method for Python 3.

4.) My goals are to find a method for testing the characters and generalize a function to remove them. Then, I would like to create other methods for reading in each column.
